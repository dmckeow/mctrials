### Bugs

### Pipeline, workflow, function, etc
* 80-80-80 should happen before first curation step
* TEs classes that RepeatModeler is bad at should be classified by their dedicated tools and integrated BEFORE the manual curation:
  * Helitrons
  * Polintons/Mavericks - Polinton detection can be expanded for specific lineages using HMM homology against an expanded database of polinton MCP/pPolB https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-025-02148-0#Sec16

### QoL features
#### Input data
* **Make species & strain mandatory - give error if no species name provided**
* **Auto replace spaces with underscore in paths/files named using species/strain**
  *** Also do not permit other bad characters in species/strain names**
* **Delete button for Input Data**
* **Various steps need indication that they are running:**
  * **BUSCO**
* **Keep original copies visible after trimming to compare before vs after trimming copy numbers**

#### General
* **Output of TEammo.log could be accessible through app**
