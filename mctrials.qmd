### Bugs

### Pipeline, workflow, function, etc
* **Command line entry point needs to be clear**
  * **Users who can't/won't run MCHelper, TEAid or (or 80-80-80?) through app need clear instructions on how they need to run these tools externally so that they can load them in the app and do manual inspection**
  * **A very nice thing would be a Nextflow pipeline (I can write this later) that will make running the pre-manual inspection auto steps easy to run**
* **80-80-80 should happen before first curation step**
* **Button to download final results And message to tell user their path**
* **Most of the steps do not appear automatically when they are done - the results do not appear until you either click Run again, or refresh manually**
* **Running the 80-80-80 and 70-70-70 and incomplete steps is strange, they can complete but it is not very clear to the user what has happened**
* **TEs classes that RepeatModeler is bad at should be classified by their dedicated tools and integrated BEFORE the manual curation:**
  * **Helitrons**
  * **Polintons/Mavericks - Polinton detection can be expanded for specific lineages using HMM homology against an expanded database of polinton MCP/pPolB https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-025-02148-0#Sec16**

### QoL features
#### Input data
* **Make species & strain mandatory - give error if no species name provided**
* **Auto replace spaces with underscore in paths/files named using species/strain**
  *** Also do not permit other bad characters in species/strain names**
* **Delete button for Input Data**
* **Various steps need indication that they are running:**
  * **BUSCO**
* **Keep original copies visible after trimming to compare before vs after trimming copy numbers**

#### General
* **Output of TEammo.log could be accessible through app**
